<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

MyGPSTracker evolved from a common interests of asset tracking and mapping technologies. Millions of developers and individual site owners have deployed both the Leaflet and GPSTracker applications independently. Now the ability to possess a pre-combined, server/database flexible, easy to install, realtime tracking solution is now a reality. We have taken the unbelievable versatility of the Leaflet mapping solution and combined with the stable tracking capability of GPSTracker. The MyGPSTracker solution offers several server side operating systems, database combinations and several phone client options to serve your variable deployment needs. Take your tracking development creativity to a whole new level with the Leaflet mapping canvas, as developers we have put every consideration in ease of installation, versatility and speed of a successful deployment.

<b>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</b>

This project allows you to track cell phones periodically. For instance every minute or every five minutes. You can watch the cell phone being tracked in “Real-Time” using Leaflet Maps (and other map tile providers such as OpenStreetMaps, OpenCycleMaps, etc..) and Leaflet Realtime. You can also store and reload routes easily, customize your map icons and more. The map display page is built using HTML5, CSS and JS which makes the page responsive and also uses CSS3 which gives you unlimited control to theme with your own site look and feel. There are 4 phone clients, iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Java ME. Choose from the following server side solutions; ASP.NET with SQL Server, PHP with your choice of: (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) or the new WordPress plugin with a dedicated Android client. 

<b>SUPPORT ROLES, STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT</b>

There are plenty of opportunities to participate in a number of different development and community roles. We have introduced our web presence at http://www.mygpstracker.xyz that includes a download section, community and support area. Github will be the ongoing development leg for:

If you are a <b>software developer</b> interested in phone tracking and have skills in at least one of:
<ul>
<li>Server Side Applications - ASP(.NET) SQL Server; PHP, Mysql, Sqlite and Postgresql</li>
<li>Phone Clients - IOS, Android, Windows and Blackberry</li>
<li>Wordpress - Plugin and dedicated Android client</li>
</ul>
then please download the GpsTracker code from github and contriblute to making GpsTracker better!

(Or) If you are a <b>web site implementor</b> interested in integrating GpsTracker into your web site, you'll need to:
<ul>
<li>Configure a web server such as Apache and set up PHP scripting (or IIS and dotNet)</li>
<li>Install and configure one of the databases compatible with GpsTracker (MySql, SQLite, PostgreSQL, SqlServer)</li>
<li>Create Javascript (using one of GpsTracker's examples) to get locations from the database and display them on a map.</li></ul>

You will need to be comfortable editing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL scripts, as well as using your brower's Developer Tools to find and solve coding problems.

(Or) If you are <b>simply a phone user</b> interested in seeing your (or someone elses) location on a map without any effort, this application is probobly not for you.  Have a look in the Play Store for a different app.

While we're happy to answer simple questions on our Forum for free, if you need help with integrating GpsTracker or MyGPSTracker please consider contracting one of our developers listed in our support forums.
